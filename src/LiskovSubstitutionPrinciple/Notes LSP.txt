* Liskov substitution principle
	let be a property provable about objects x of type T. Then should be true for objects Y of type S where S is a subtype of T. 

	Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types. 


* Detecting LSP violations in your code 
	Type checking with is or as in polymorphic code. 
	Null checks 
	NotImplementedException

* Fixing LSP violations
	Follow the 'tell, don't ask' principle
	Minimize null checks with 
		C# features
		Guard clauses.
		Null object desing pattern
	Follow ISP and be sure to fully implement interfaces.
