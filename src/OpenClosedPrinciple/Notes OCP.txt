Open / Closed Principle

Software entitie (classes, modules, functions, etc.) Should be open for extesion, but closed for modification. 
It should be possible to change the behavior of a method without editing its source code. 


Open to extesion = new behavior can be added in the future, code that is closed to extesion has fixed behavior. 


Closed to modification = Changes to source or binary code are not required. The only way to change the behavior of code that is closed
to extension is to change the code itself.

* One way to extension
public class DoAnything<Targ, TResult>{
private Func<Targ, TResult> _function;

public TResult Execute(TArg a)
{return _function}
}

* another way 
using abstract class
